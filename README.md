# CNN-SinhalaCharRecognition
Welcome to CNN-SinhalaCharRecognition, a pioneering project aimed at harnessing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the recognition and classification of specific characters from the Sinhala alphabet. Our project focuses on two primary characters: 'අ' and 'ජ'

Results
The results section provides a comprehensive overview of the model's performance, including accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and visual representations of the model's classification capabilities. Our preliminary findings suggest promising directions for further research and potential applications in automated text recognition and digital archiving of Sinhala texts.

Getting Started
For those interested in exploring the project further, the repository includes:

Code: Complete source code for the CNN model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
Dataset: Access to the dataset used in this project, along with guidelines on how to expand it or adapt it for similar projects.


Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's expanding the dataset, refining the model, or applying the project to new contexts, we encourage collaboration and innovation.
